# Engine Room Operation
    
A simple PWA to train my first steps in web development studies.  

I used Chart.JS to produce the graphs, based on the information I like to see in my day to day work.  

I took a ServiceWorker based on the Academind course at udemy.com.  

I wrote all the javascript, html and css code.

Thanks!
